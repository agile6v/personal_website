My first blog post.

Hi, there.

THis is my first blog post. For a long time I want to build a blog that belong to my own. But due to my inertia and then there has been no action. Now I set out to build it, I hope to have a good New Year beginning.

Why the title of this post is called "hello world"?


All programmers know that "hello world" is usually used as getting started to learn a new programming language, it shows us the programming language how to complie and run.
So I also used it as the title of this post for my blog beginning. 
The main purpose to build this blog is to write down technical problems, personal life and work at ordinary times. 

As the saying goes, "Well begun is half done.".

All right, go ahead.
